[XX] - YYYY-MM-DD
=================

Added
-----

Changed
-------

Deprecated
----------

Fixed
-----

Removed
-------

[85] - 2025-07-28
=================

Fixed
-----

-  Fix systemd-networkd drop-in configuration path.

[84] - 2025-06-26
=================

Added
-----

- Added ``mmc-utils`` to releng packages. It can be used to configure MMC and eMMC storage devices.

Changed
-------

- Undeprecate ``/${install_dir}/grubenv``. There are use cases that rely on extracting only the ``${install_dir}`` from
  the ISO.
- Use ``xdg-open`` instead of hardcoding the web browser in the ``Installation_guide`` script.

Removed
-------

- Removed ``rp-pppoe`` from releng packages. ``ppp`` provides a PPPoE client that is sufficient for most use cases.

[83] - 2025-03-24
=================

Changed
-------

- Remove the pacstrap directory early to lower the maximum size of the working directory.

Fixed
-----

- Do not hide ``pacstrap`` errors in non-verbose mode.

Removed
-------

- Removed deprecated dhclient from packages.

[82] - 2024-11-27
=================

Fixed
-----

- Commented out ``DownloadUser`` in ``pacman.conf`` so that the working directory is not restricted to paths to which
  the ``alpm`` user has access to.

[81] - 2024-10-28
=================

Fixed
-----

- Change enabled services in baseline and releng profile to adapt to changes in ``cloud-init`` ≥ 24.3 (renamed
  ``cloud-init.service`` to ``cloud-init-network.service``, introduced new ``cloud-init-main.service``).

Removed
-------

- Removed gnu-netcat from releng profile, as cloud-init requires openbsd-netcat and the two netcat versions can not be
  installed side-by-side.

[80] - 2024-09-26
=================

Added
-----

- Support compressing the bootstrap tarball with ``xz``.

Changed
-------

- Use an empty UUID for the EROFS image file since the file system will never be referenced by it.
- Do not use ``mkfs.erofs`` extended options ``fragments`` and ``dedupe`` in the baseline profile. This reduces the EROFS
  image size and compression time.
- Update profile ``pacman.conf`` to include the new options added to ``/etc/pacman.conf`` in pacman 7.0.0.r3.g7736133-1.

Fixed
-----

- Show the correct image file name, including the extension, when building a bootstrap image.

Removed
-------

- Removed reiserfsprogs from packages (EOL)

[79] - 2024-07-25
=================

Fixed
-----

- When downloading an automation script fail with non-zero status code instead of returning an HTML document when the
  remote HTTP server fails to deliver the document.

Removed
-------

- Remove unneeded workaround for e2fsprogs < 1.47.1.

[78] - 2024-05-23
=================

Changed
-------

- Moved the ``pkglist.x86_64.txt`` file outside the bootstrap tarball's ``root.x86_64`` directly to avoid polluting the
  root file system.
- Use 4 MiB OVMF files in ``run_archiso`` instead of the old 2 MiB ones.
- Increase the additional free space of the EFI partition size from 1 MiB to 8 MiB to account for file system overhead
  when using FAT32 (needs less than 1 MiB) and to give more space for adding custom files when repacking an ISO (e.g.
  when preparing it for Secure Boot).
- Remove 300 KiB padding needed for CDs if the ISO exceeds the maximum size of a CD.
- Use ``xz -9e`` as the releng profile's initramfs compression. Now that mkinitcpio does not decompress the loadable
  kernel modules and firmware files anymore and moves them to the early uncompressed initramfs, we can compress the main
  initramfs image with a higher compression without it having much impact on the ISO build time.
- Format the EFI system partition image as FAT32 if the size allows it (i.e. if it is at least 36 MiB).

Fixed
-----

- Look for microcode update files in the initramfs images when checking if external microcode images are needed. The
  existence of a ``early_cpio`` file is not enough since mkinitcpio can and will place other files in the early
  uncompressed CPIO even when the ``microcode`` hook is not used.

Removed
-------

- Remove the wezterm-terminfo package from the releng profile as the relevant file is now provided by the ncurses
  package instead.

[77] - 2024-04-21
=================

Added
-----

- Copy Memtest86+ EFI binary to the EFI system partition and ISO 9660 for ``uefi-x86.systemd-boot`` boot modes.
  Additionally, create a boot entry with it for the releng profile.

Changed
-------

- Change releng profile's bootstrap tarball compression from gzip to zstd. zstd provides higher and faster compression.
- Use mkinitcpio's ``microcode`` hook instead of external microcode images to simplify boot loader configuration.
  Custom PXE setups will need to update their boot loader configuration.
- Replace ``archisodevice`` boot parameter with ``archisosearchuuid`` in all boot loader configuration. This allows to
  have "file system transposition" without relaying on GRUB-specific features.
- Replace GRUB with systemd-boot as the UEFI boot loader for the releng profile. While this increases the ISO size, it
  avoids all GRUB-specific annoyances and oddities.

Fixed
-----

- Fix requirement validation logic for the ``uefi-ia32.systemd-boot.eltorito`` boot mode. It incorrectly applied the
  same requirements as ``uefi-x64.systemd-boot.esp``.

[76] - 2024-03-30
=================

Added
-----

- Add a man page for ``mkarchiso``.
- Implement configurable bootstrap tarball compression. It is configured in ``profiledef.sh`` using a bash array called
  ``bootstrap_tarball_compression``. baseline tarball now uses zstd compression while releng remains with gzip for now.

Changed
-------

- Move ``/boot/grub/YYYY-mm-dd-HH-MM-SS-00.uuid`` to ``/boot/YYYY-mm-dd-HH-MM-SS-00.uuid`` and always create the file.
  Once mkinitcpio-archiso implements searching for the file in early userspace, this file's use will not be limited to
  just GRUB.
- Skip including external microcode images in build artifacts if the initramfs file contains ``early_cpio`` (indicating
  an early uncompressed CPIO archive which should have the microcode update files).

Removed
-------

- Remove workaround for glibc < 2.39. ``LC_ALL=C.UTF-8`` now overrides ``LANGUAGE``, just like ``LC_ALL=C``.

[75] - 2024-01-24
=================

Added
-----

- Explicitly add ldns to releng (as opposed to it only being pulled in as a dependency of another package) to ensure
  ``drill`` remains available.

Changed
-------

- Update the releng ISO description to "Arch Linux Live/Rescue DVD" since the ISO size now exceeds the maximum size of
  a CD (900 MiB).

Fixed
-----

- Update the location where ``mkarchiso`` looks for the memtest86+ license file.

[74] - 2023-12-21
=================

Added
-----

- Add bcachefs-tools to releng for access to bcachefs userspace tools.
- Add tftp as a valid protocol for downloading automated boot script.

Changed
-------

- Set ``RequiredForOnline=routable`` in systemd-networkd configuration files to improve the chances that the network
  really is *online* when ``network-online.target`` is reached.

Fixed
-----

- Add missing replacement for the UUID variable in systemd-boot configuration files on ISO 9660.

[73] - 2023-09-29
=================

Added
-----

- Add bolt to releng for authorizing and otherwise managing Thunderbolt and USB4 devices.
- Add ``uefi-ia32.systemd-boot.esp`` and ``uefi-ia32.systemd-boot.eltorito`` boot modes that use systemd-boot for IA32
  UEFI. The boot modes of baseline and releng are not changed.
- Add GRUB configuration file ``/boot/grub/loopback.cfg`` to the releng and baseline profiles. It sets the necessary
  boot parameters required for booting the ISO image as a file on a file system.

Fixed
-----

- Add ``/etc/localtime`` to the baseline profile to ensure the ISO can be booted successfully without triggering
  questions from systemd-firstboot.

[72] - 2023-08-29
=================

Added
-----

- Add tpm2-tools to releng to allow clearing, creating and reading keys on the TPM.
- Add sequoia-sq and openpgp-card-tools as additional tooling for working with OpenPGP certificates and smartcards.

Changed
-------

- Moved custom ``mkinitcpio.conf`` files to ``/etc/mkinitcpio.conf.d/archiso.conf``.
- Mount ``/etc/pacman.d/gnupg`` on tmpfs with option ``noswap`` instead of using ramfs. This ensures there is a limit to
  the file system size.
- Enable systemd-networkd's support for IPv6 Privacy Extensions globally instead of per-connection.
- Moved custom ``sshd_config`` files to ``/ssh/sshd_config.d/10-archiso.conf``
- Use pcsclite for interfacing with smartcards, since both gnupg and opgpcard support it.

Fixed
-----

- Sign the root file system image only once.
- Make sure xorriso does not read its configuration files to prevent interference and unintended behavior.

[71] - 2023-05-28
=================

Added
-----

- Added classes for Memtest86+ and UEFI Shell menuentries.
- Add foot-terminfo and wezterm-terminfo packages to releng to support terminal emulators using them. E.g. when
  installing via SSH.
- Add a new ``-r`` option to ``mkarchiso`` that deletes the working directly after the build.
- Add support for mDNS announce and resolve.

Changed
-------

- Increase EROFS compression for the baseline profile by using an extreme LZMA compression level and enabling the
  experimental compressed fragments and data deduplication features.
- Identify the ISO volume via a UUID instead of a file system label in all boot loader configuration files.
- Update ``pacman.conf`` to match the one shipped with pacman 6.0.2-7 which removes the community repository.

Fixed
-----

- Wait for ``network-online.target`` to become active before trying to download the script passed via the ``script=``
  boot parameter.
- Subdirectories from ``grub/`` are copied to the ISO.
- Modify the commandline options to a ``cp`` command in ``mkarchiso`` so that the entire script does not exit with
  failure when a custom ``.bashrc`` file is supplied with the archiso configuration. This fix was needed after
  **GNU Coreutils** recently changed the behaviour of the ``-n`` (or ``--no-clobber``) commandline option to the ``cp``
  command.
- Ensure ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`` is read from the ``build_date`` file before ``profiledef.sh`` is sourced to ensure the
  variable has a correct value when used inside ``profiledef.sh``.

[70] - 2023-02-27
=================

Added
-----

- Support *file system transposition* to simplify boot medium preparation for UEFI boot via extracting the ISO image
  contents to a drive. ``grub.cfg`` does not hardcode the ISO volume label anymore, instead GRUB will search for volume
  with a ``/boot/grub/YYYY-mm-dd-HH-MM-SS-00.uuid`` file on it.
- Preload GRUB's NTFS modules for UEFI that allegedly have native NTFS support. GRUB's exFAT and UDF modules are also
  preloaded in case someone finds them useful.

Changed
-------

- Identify the ISO volume via a UUID instead of a file system label to avoid collisions of multiple ISOs created in the
  same month.
- Honor ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`` in the ``date`` command used by ``profiledef.sh`` of the shipped profiles.
- Do not duplicate ``grub.cfg`` in both ISO 9660 and the EFI system partition / El Torito image. GRUB will search for
  the ISO volume and load the ``grub.cfg`` from there.
- Moved GRUB files on ISO 9660 from ``/EFI/BOOT/`` to a boot-platform neutral place ``/boot/grub/``. This does not apply
  to the EFI binaries that remain in the default/fallback boot path.
- Move ``grubenv`` to ``/boot/grub/grubenv`` on ISO 9660 so that it is together with the rest of GRUB-specific files.
  Additionally write more variables in it. The previous ``/${install_dir}/grubenv`` (``/arch/grubenv`` for releng)
  is deprecated and a future archiso release will not create this file anymore.
- Moved syslinux directory from ``/syslinux/`` to ``/boot/syslinux/`` to keep most boot loader files in ``/boot/``.
- Update ``README.transfer`` documentation and convert it to reStructuredText.
- Use ``console`` as grub's ``terminal_output``, as ``gfxterm`` leads to a blank screen on some hardware.

Removed
-------

- Do not place memtest86+ in netboot artifacts.

[69] - 2022-12-24
=================

Added
-----

- Add Memtest86+ to x86_64 UEFI GRUB boot menu.

Changed
-------

- Check if the GPG public key file was successfully placed in the work directory before trying to use it.
- Open the file descriptors for code signing certificates and GPG public key as read only. Nothing from the within the
  ``pacstrap`` invoked chroot should ever be allowed to write outside of it.
- Error out early if any of the code signing certificate files passed with option ``-c`` do not exist.
- Use LZMA compressed EROFS image for the baseline profile. Now that xz 5.4 is out and erofs-utils is built with LZMA
  support, using a higher compression is possible.
- Add ``/etc/machine-id`` with special value ``uninitialized``. The final id is generated at boot time, and systemd's
  first-boot mechanim (see ``First Boot Semantics`` in ``machine-id(5)``) applies. No functional change unless that
  ``ConditionFirstBoot=yes`` is true and passive unit ``first-boot-complete.target`` activates for ordering.

[68] - 2022-10-30
=================

Changed
-------

- Do not explicitly enable ``qemu-guest-agent.service`` as it will be started by a udev rule.
- Remove existing signature (``.sig``) files and do not sign them when signing netboot artifacts. This is mostly
  applicable when re-running ``mkarchiso``  after a failure.
- Replace ``archiso_kms`` with ``kms`` in ``mkinitcpio.conf``. The hook is available in mkinitcpio since version 32.

[67] - 2022-09-25
=================

Added
-----

- The ability to generate rootfs signatures using openssl CMS module if ``-c`` is given.

Changed
-------

- Order ``pacman-init.service`` before ``archlinux-keyring-wkd-sync.service`` since
  ``archlinux-keyring-wkd-sync.service`` needs an initialized pacman keyring.
- Order ``pacman-init.service`` after ``time-sync.target`` since ``pacman-init.service`` may otherwise create local
  signatures that are not valid on target systems after installation.

[66] - 2022-08-28
=================

Added
-----

- Add ``efibootimg`` to ``mkarchiso`` to abstract the FAT image path.
- Unset ``LANGUAGE`` since ``LC_ALL=C.UTF-8``, unlike ``LC_ALL=C``, does not override ``LANGUAGE``.
- Copy all files from the ``grub`` directory to ISO9660 and the FAT image, not just only ``grub.cfg``.
- Touching ``/usr/lib/clock-epoch`` to to help ``systemd`` with screwed or broken RTC.

Changed
-------

- Disable GRUB's shim_lock verifier and preload more modules. This allows reusing the GRUB EFI binaries when repacking
  the ISO to support Secure Boot with custom signatures.

[65] - 2022-06-30
=================

Added
-----

- Configure the locale for the baseline profile to ``C.UTF-8`` so that a UTF-8 locale is used.
- Add ``uefi-x64.grub.esp`` and ``uefi-x64.grub.eltorito`` boot mode to support x86_64 UEFI boot on x86_64 machines.
- Use ``mkfs.erofs``'s ``ztailpacking`` option in the baseline profile to reduce the image size.

Changed
-------

- Change the releng profile's locale from ``en_US.UTF-8`` to ``C.UTF-8``.
- Set ``LC_ALL`` to ``C.UTF-8`` instead of ``C`` in mkarchiso since it is now available and non-UTF-8 locales should be
  avoided.

Removed
-------

- Remove the custom pacman hook that ran ``locale-gen`` on glibc install from the releng profile. The used locale now
  ships with the glibc package itself.
- Remove "Copy to RAM" boot entries since the ``archiso`` mkinitcpio hook enables it automatically when there is enough
  free RAM.

[64] - 2022-05-30
=================

Added
-----

- Add ``uefi-ia32.grub.esp`` boot mode to support IA32 UEFI boot on x86_64 machines.
- Add GRUB configuration files to profiles.
- Add accessible ``copytoram`` entry.
- Enable beeps in systemd-boot menu.

Changed
-------

- Fix systemd-boot menu entry sorting by using the ``sort-key`` option.

[63] - 2022-04-30
=================

Added
-----

- Add dmidecode to the list of packages in the releng profile.
- Add open-iscsi to the list of packages in the releng profile to allow installing Arch on an iSCSI target.
- Add open-vm-tools and hyperv to the list of packages and enable their services to provide better integration with the
  VMware and Hyper-V hypervisors.

Changed
-------

- Mount /etc/pacman.d/gnupg on ramfs instead of tmpfs to ensure its contents never land in swap.
- Configure reflector to return only mirrors that support both IPv4 and IPv6.


[62.1] - 2022-04-05
===================

Removed
-------

- Easter egg

[62] - 2022-03-31
=================

Changed
-------

- Fix the PXE support. PXELINUX was having trouble finding the kernel and initrds. Now, archiso forces syslinux to
  interpret all TFTP paths as absolute. That seems to have solved the issue.
- Disable systemd-gpt-auto-generator, which we do not need, in both baseline and releng profiles. It avoids the error
  message about it failing during boot.

[61] - 2022-01-31
=================

Added
-----

- Add linux-firmware-marvell to the list of packages in the releng profile (e.g. for Surface Pro 6 WiFi support)
- Add documentation to systemd-networkd configuration files
- Add information about the use of changelog and merge requests to the contributing guidelines
- Make the CI pipelines more efficient by automatically cancelling running pipelines if they are superseded by a newer
  commit and by only running build pipelines on code or profile changes

Changed
-------

- Fix an issue where mkarchiso is failing to raise an error when the ``mmd`` and ``mcopy`` commands are not found
- Fix an issue where the architecture detection in mkarchiso fails due to an unset ``arch`` variable in the profile

Removed
-------

[60] - 2021-12-28
=================

Added
-----

- Add `BB8E6F1B81CF0BB301D74D1CBF425A01E68B38EF` in the Releases section of the README, giving maintainer power to
  nl6720.

Changed
-------

- Show a more descriptive message when no code signing certificate is used

Removed
-------

- Remove unused archiso_shutdown hook from the releng profile's mkinitcpio config

[59] - 2021-11-30
=================

Added
-----

- Add mailmap file for easier author integration with git
- Add grub and refind to the package list of the releng profile

Changed
-------

- Replace use of date with printf
- Silence command output more efficiently when using --quiet
- Modify curl call to retry up to ten times before giving up on downloading an automated script

Removed
-------

- Remove requirement on setting a Boot mode when building a netboot image

[58] - 2021-08-25
=================

Added
-----

- Add support for ``gpg``'s ``--sender`` option

Changed
-------

- Change the way ``mkarchiso`` uses ext4 images to copying files to it directly instead of mounting (this action now
  does not require elevated privileges anymore)
- Add version files when using ``netboot`` buildmode as well
- Update the sshd configuration to be compatible with openssh 8.7p1
- Overhaul the used ``gpg`` options
- Fix use of potentially unbound variables
- Refactor the validation functions to have fewer large functions and less code duplication

Removed
-------

- Remove all files related to ``mkinitcpio`` integration, as they now live in
  https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/mkinitcpio/mkinitcpio-archiso

[57] - 2021-07-30
=================

Added
-----

- Add a missing line in the systemd-networkd-wait-online.service in the baseline profile

Changed
-------

- Adapt systemd-networkd configuration to systemd ≥ 249
- Improve documentation in ``mkarchiso`` and systemd-networkd related configuration files
- Fix an issue that may prevent continuing an aborted build of the ``netboot`` or ``iso`` buildmode

Removed
-------

- Remove SPDX license identifier from files that are not eligible for copyright (e.g. configuration files)

-----

Changed
-------

- Simplify gitlab CI setup by using ci-scripts (shared amongst several projects)
- Fix an issue with the unsetting of environment variables before using pacstrap/arch-chroot

  (optionally allowing codesigning on the artifacts), by using the new buildmode `netboot`
- Add qemu-guest-agent and virtualbox-guest-utils-nox to the releng profile and enable their services by default to
  allow interaction between hypervisor and virtual machine if the installation medium is booted in a virtualized
  environment

Changed
-------

- Always use the .sig file extension when signing the rootfs image, as that is how mkinitcpio-archiso expects it
- Fix for CI and run_archiso scripts to be compatible with QEMU >= 6.0
- Increase robustness of CI by granting more time to reach the first prompt
- Change CI to build all available buildmodes of the baseline and releng profiles (baseline's netboot is currently
  excluded due to a bug)
- Install all implicitly installed packages explicitly for the releng profile
- Install keyrings more generically when using pacman-init.service
- Consolidate CI scripts so that they may be shared between the archiso, arch-boxes and releng project in the future and
